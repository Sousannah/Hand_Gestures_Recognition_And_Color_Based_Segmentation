# Hand_Gestures_Recognition_And_Color_Based_Segmentation
In this git hub repository you will find a code that train the CNN model step by step and then test this model through live video by using CVZone and OpenCV libraries to detect and crop hands 
In this code it will detect blue gloves using opencv for color detection through live video and crop it and then resize the hand to make it bigger and then segment it using color based segmentation and send it to the CNN to classify it
